# Turtle Crossing App
The Turtle Crossing App is an exciting Python game that challenges players to guide a turtle across a busy road while avoiding oncoming traffic. The game features a dynamic environment with moving cars, a player-controlled turtle, and a scoreboard that tracks the player's progress and levels.

# Features
Navigate a turtle across a busy road to reach the other side safely.
Dodge oncoming traffic as you progress through different levels.
Keep track of your score and level with an interactive scoreboard.
Observe road lines for added realism and atmosphere.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.x
turtle module (standard library)

# Usage
1. Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from the official Python website.

2. Ensure you have the required files (player.py, scoreboard.py, car_manager.py, road_lines.py) in the same directory as your main script.

3. Open a new Python file or interactive environment.

4. Copy and paste the provided code into your Python environment.

5. Run the code. A window will appear displaying the game environment.

6. Use the Up arrow key to move the turtle forward and attempt to cross the road.

7. Dodge the moving cars and reach the other side to advance to the next level.

8. The game ends if the turtle collides with a car. You'll see a "Game Over" message on the screen.

9. Click anywhere on the window to close the game.

# Customization
You can customize various aspects of the game to enhance the player's experience:

Adjust the screen.setup() values to change the window size.
Modify colors, fonts, and positioning in the Scoreboard class to personalize the scoreboard's appearance.
Customize car speeds and appearance in the CarManager class.
Experiment with the turtle's movement speed and characteristics.
